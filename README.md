# Budget Planner

Budget Planner is a "simple" thing to help me plan my budget. I am trying to create something that can also be used by others aswell.

    I finally managed to work out how to extract user input using Inquire and then determine which "page" to load next. I also created a basic greeter function that randomly selects a message from a list, still needs some more work to make it easily expandable. I also created a basic dashboard that lists the 15 most recent expenses in descending order, of course this requires proper formatting which is might be a pain to set up later. But hey my code works with no errors or warnings.

    Tried to find a method to extract the user choice from Inquire, could not find method at this time. For now I'm going to switch to front-end web-app and see if my luck is better there......

    Created a basic CLI input along with README, will continue to update as I learn rust.
